Another CRUD Web interface, this time i used an API from StartBootstrap, and implemented Spring Boot.
The function I created in the API is to register and log in a user.
This app is compiled on java 17. Maven 3.9.2.

///////////////
INSTRUCTIONS:
This app runs on port 8081 so open your browser and type: http://localhost:8081/
Once the page is loaded, you should go to pages > "login" or "register" and proceed to create your accounts to manage users.
